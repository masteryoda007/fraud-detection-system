# 🔒 Phase 1: Advanced Fraud Detection MVP

*Production-grade machine learning system with explainable AI and conversational interface*

## 🎯 What This Is

Phase 1 is a comprehensive fraud detection system that proves the core ML algorithms work before building production infrastructure. After getting frustrated with legacy rule-based systems that flag legitimate transactions while missing obvious fraud, I built this as a complete solution that actually works.

### ⚡ Key Achievements

- **🤖 99.5%+ AUC** with advanced ML ensemble
- **💡 Explainable AI** with SHAP for regulatory compliance  
- **🔍 Vector Search** to find similar fraud patterns
- **💬 AI Chat** for natural language fraud analysis
- **📊 Production UI** that business users actually love
- **⚡ Real-time** predictions under 100ms

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- 4GB+ RAM (ML models can be memory-hungry)
- Optional: OpenAI API key for full AI chat features

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/masteryoda007/fraud-detection-system.git
cd fraud-detection-system/phase1-streamlit-mvp

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv fraud_detection_env

# 3. Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source fraud_detection_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
fraud_detection_env\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Optional: Enable AI Chat

```bash
# Get API key from platform.openai.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Restart the app
streamlit run app.py
```

**Don't worry about costs** - I built in strict daily limits (max $1/day) after learning the hard way! 💸

150K transactions  40+ features    4 algorithms   Interpretability  Risk scoring
```

### Model Ensemble

1. **XGBoost** (40% weight) - Primary model, consistently best performance
2. **Random Forest** (25% weight) - Good interpretability and stability  
3. **LightGBM** (25% weight) - Fast inference for real-time scoring
4. **Isolation Forest** (10% weight) - Catches unusual anomaly patterns

### Feature Engineering

- **Time patterns**: Hour, weekend, business hours, night flags
- **Amount analysis**: Log transforms, percentiles, round number detection
- **V-feature aggregations**: Statistical summaries of PCA components
- **Interaction terms**: Amount × time, feature cross-products
- **Risk indicators**: High/low amount flags, extreme value detection

### Data Quality

- **Realistic fraud patterns** based on industry research
- **Proper class imbalance** (0.17% fraud rate - real-world accurate)
- **Advanced SMOTE** handling for training data balance
- **Comprehensive validation** with holdout test sets

## 📈 Performance Metrics

conda install -c conda-forge shap
```

**❌ FAISS installation fails**  
```bash
# Use CPU version for compatibility
pip install faiss-cpu
```

**❌ Memory errors during model training**
```bash
# Reduce dataset size in app.py
# Change n_samples from 150000 to 50000
```

**❌ OpenAI API errors**
```bash
# Check your API key is valid
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify you have credits at platform.openai.com
