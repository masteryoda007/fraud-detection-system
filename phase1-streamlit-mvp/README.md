## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Installation Problems**

**Issue**: `ImportError` for ML packages
```bash
# Solution: Use conda for ML packages
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm
```

**Issue**: FAISS installation fails
```bash
# Solution: Use conda instead of pip
conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu
```

**Issue**: SHAP compilation errors
```bash
# Solution: Install build tools first
conda install -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64  # Linux
conda install -c conda-forge clang_osx-64  # Mac
```

#### **Runtime Issues**

**Issue**: "Models not trained yet"
- **Solution**: Go to Dashboard tab first to load data and train models

**Issue**: "SHAP explainer not available"
- **Solution**: Install SHAP: `pip install shap`

**Issue**: "Vector search disabled"
- **Solution**: Install FAISS: `conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu`

**Issue**: OpenAI rate limits
- **Solution**: App has built-in limits, wait for daily reset or check usage in sidebar

#### **Performance Issues**

**Issue**: Slow model training
- **Solution**: Reduce dataset size in `EnhancedDataManager._generate_normal_transactions()`

**Issue**: Memory errors with SHAP
- **Solution**: Reduce sample size in `_train_shap_explainer()` method

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### **Data Security**
- ✅ No real customer data - uses synthetic transactions
- ✅ Local processing - no data sent to external services
- ✅ OpenAI integration uses environment variables only

### **API Security**  
- ✅ OpenAI API key via environment variables
- ✅ Built-in cost controls and rate limiting
- ✅ Automatic fallback when API unavailable

### **Best Practices**
- ✅ Never commit API keys to version control
- ✅ Use conda environments for dependency isolation
- ✅ Regular security updates for dependencies
