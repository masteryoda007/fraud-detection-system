## üéØ **Core Architecture Decisions**

### **Why Ensemble Methods Over Single Models?**

**Decision**: 4-model ensemble (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, Isolation Forest)

**Technical Rationale**:
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Different algorithms capture different patterns
- **Robustness**: Ensemble reduces overfitting risk in production
- **Fraud Domain**: Tree-based models excel at capturing non-linear fraud patterns
- **Production Stability**: If one model fails, ensemble continues operating

**Implementation Details**:
- Weighted voting based on individual model AUC performance
- Proper cross-validation to prevent data leakage
- Stratified sampling to maintain fraud class distribution

### **Why SMOTE for Class Imbalance?**

**Challenge**: 0.17% fraud rate (284 fraud / 150K+ total transactions)

**Decision**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

**Technical Rationale**:
- **Better than simple oversampling**: Creates synthetic samples, not duplicates
- **Preserves data distribution**: Maintains realistic feature relationships
- **Production applicability**: Real fraud datasets have similar imbalance
- **Validated approach**: Applied only to training data, not validation

## üîç **Advanced ML Engineering**

### **Feature Engineering Strategy**

**60+ Engineered Features** designed for fraud detection:

**Temporal Features**:
- `hour_sin/cos`: Cyclical encoding for time-based fraud patterns
- `is_weekend`: Weekend vs weekday fraud behavior differences
- `days_since_last_transaction`: Velocity-based fraud indicators

**Statistical Features**:
- `amount_zscore_user`: User-specific spending pattern deviations
- `merchant_risk_score`: Historical merchant fraud rates
- `velocity_features`: Transaction frequency indicators

**Interaction Features**:
- `amount_merchant_interaction`: Amount patterns per merchant type
- `user_merchant_frequency`: User-merchant relationship strength

### **Model Validation Strategy**

**Cross-Validation Approach**:
- **Stratified K-Fold (5 splits)**: Maintains fraud distribution
- **Time-series aware**: Respects temporal ordering for realistic validation
- **Separate test set**: 20% holdout for final evaluation

**Metrics Selection**:
- **Primary**: AUC-ROC (handles class imbalance well)
- **Secondary**: Precision-Recall AUC (focus on fraud detection)
- **Business**: False Positive Rate (customer experience impact)

## üöÄ **Production Engineering Decisions**

### **Why Streamlit for MVP?**

**Decision**: Streamlit over Flask/FastAPI for Phase 1

**Strategic Rationale**:
- **Rapid prototyping**: Get stakeholder feedback quickly
- **Built-in UI components**: Focus on ML, not frontend development
- **Easy deployment**: Streamlit Cloud for instant demos
- **Iterative development**: Perfect for MVP validation

**Production Considerations**:
- Phase 2 will migrate to FastAPI for production APIs
- Current architecture designed for easy migration
- Clear separation of ML logic from UI logic

### **Error Handling & Graceful Degradation**

**Production-Ready Error Handling**:

**Model Failures**:
- Fallback to individual models if ensemble fails
- Rule-based scoring if all ML models fail
- User-friendly error messages, technical logs for debugging

**API Failures (OpenAI)**:
- Cost controls: $1/day limit with automatic shutoff
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/day per user
- Graceful fallback to rule-based chat responses

**Data Issues**:
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Missing feature handling with median/mode imputation
- Outlier detection and capping

## üî¨ **Advanced AI Integration**

### **SHAP Explainability Implementation**

**Why SHAP Over LIME?**:
- **Consistent**: Shapley values provide theoretically sound explanations
- **Ensemble support**: Works well with tree-based ensemble models
- **Production speed**: TreeExplainer is fast enough for real-time use

### **Vector Similarity Search Architecture**

**Why FAISS Over Alternatives?**
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-dimensional similarity search
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of vectors efficiently
- **Flexibility**: Multiple index types for different use cases

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Feature vectors**: Embeddings of transaction features
- **Similarity metrics**: Cosine similarity for fraud pattern matching
- **Real-time updates**: Incremental index updates for new transactions

## üí° **AI Chat System Design**

### **Conversation Context Management**

**Challenge**: Maintain conversation context while controlling costs

**Solution**: Hybrid approach
- **Rule-based routing**: Simple queries handled locally
- **Context summarization**: Compress conversation history
- **Smart prompting**: Efficient prompt engineering for better responses

**Cost Control Implementation**:
```python
class CostController:
    def __init__(self, daily_limit=1.0):
        self.daily_limit = daily_limit
        self.usage_tracker = DailyUsageTracker()
    
    def can_make_request(self, estimated_cost):
        return self.usage_tracker.today_cost + estimated_cost < self.daily_limit
```

## üìä **Performance Optimization**

### **Model Training Optimization**

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
- **Optuna framework**: Efficient Bayesian optimization
- **Early stopping**: Prevent overfitting and reduce training time
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-core training where possible

**Feature Selection**:
- **Correlation analysis**: Remove redundant features
- **Importance scoring**: Focus on most predictive features
- **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA for high-dimensional features

### **Inference Optimization**

**Sub-100ms Prediction Target**:
- **Model serialization**: Optimized pickle/joblib formats
- **Feature preprocessing**: Cached encoders and scalers
- **Batch prediction**: Process multiple transactions efficiently
